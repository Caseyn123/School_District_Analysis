# School_District_Analysis
School District Analysis Mod 4
## overview of the school district analysis
the purpose for this analysis was the school board notified maria and her supervisor that the file students_complete shows evidence of academic dishonesty, they don't know how much dishonesty there was but wanted to uphold the state-testing standards so they asked Maria to help. Maria changed the reading and math test scores for Thomas High School with NaN's to see how that would affect the overall analysis
## Results
even though my code did not work I can conclude that the results would show:
*the district summary is affected by changing the scores to NaN's because in the module challenge it shows that the overall passing percentage increased from 65% to 90%
*the school summary is affected because of when they take away those 9th grade student scores and change them to NaN then it will either lower or raise the average scores
*replacing the 9th graders math and reading scores will affect Thomas High School's performance compared to the other schools because it will be greatly higher, when they took away those students scores the reading and math percentage rose to 90% passing when before it was at around 60%
*replacing the 9th grade scores affects the math and reading scores by grade because now the percentage is at 90% an A and before it was at 65% which is a D
*replacing the 9th grader scores affected scores by school spending not at all, because the budget remained at $1,043,130.00
*scores by school size would get affected when taking out 9th graders because then the school size changes and the scores are higher
*scores by school type changes too because if it is a charter school those have a smaller student body compared to other schools and that would affect their scores as well
## Summary
one change was that the passing reading percentage went from 69% to 97% which is a noticeable difference
another change was that the passing math percentage also went from 66% to 93% which is another noticeable difference too
a third change was that overall passing percentage went from 65% to 90% which is a again a noticeable differnce. 
a fourth change was that the overall passing percentage went from a letter grade of D to an A
